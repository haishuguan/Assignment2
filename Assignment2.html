  <h1 class="heading">Cat</h1>
		<p>The domestic cat (Felis silvestris catus or Felis catus)<sup>[1][4]</sup> is a small, typically furry, carnivorous mammal. They are often called house cats<sup>[5]</sup> when kept as indoor pets or simply cats when there is no need to distinguish them from other felids and felines. They are often valued by humans for companionship and for their ability to hunt vermin. There are more than seventy cat breeds recognized by various cat registries. </p>

	<h2><a name="Anchor1">Behavior</a></h2>
		<p>Outdoor cats are active both day and night, although they tend to be slightly more active at night.<sup>[138][139]</sup> The timing of cats' activity is quite flexible and varied, which means house cats may be more active in the morning and evening, as a response to greater human activity at these times.<sup>[140]</sup> Although they spend the majority of their time in the vicinity of their home, housecats can range many hundreds of meters from this central point, and are known to establish territories that vary considerably in size, in one study ranging from 7 to 28 hectares (17â€“69 acres).<sup>[139]</sup> </p>
